set up master branch

1. If no branch is made, write the current commit to master branch
    How do we know if master is the current branch?
        i. If head doesn't point to any other branch(contains a commit hash)

Since we are doing this in the commit file, if commit is the current branch, 
then just take head(after its updated in commit) and make it the first line of master

If master isn't current branch, then continue by updated the current branch.
